Problem:
    Calculate the Click-Through Rate (CTR) for each ad using this formula:

        If (clicks + views) = 0, then CTR = 0.00.

        Otherwise:

        CTR =
        ( numberÂ ofÂ â€™Clickedâ€™ / (numberÂ ofÂ â€™Clickedâ€™ + numberÂ ofÂ â€™Viewedâ€™) ) Ã— 100

"""
Notes:

    1. counts.reindex(columns=['Clicked', 'Viewed'], fill_value=0)

        - counts is a DataFrame that came from a pivot table (or groupby().size().unstack()), so it has columns like Clicked, Viewed.

        - The .reindex(columns=[...]) explicitly tells pandas:
            "I only want these columns in this exact order."
            Even if a category didnâ€™t exist in the original data (e.g., no rows where action = 'Clicked'), .reindex ensures the column is there.

        - fill_value=0 means:
            If a column doesnâ€™t exist or has missing values (NaN), replace them with 0.
            ðŸ‘‰ If you already had both Clicked and Viewed columns, then fill_value=0 doesnâ€™t visibly change anything â€” thatâ€™s why you didnâ€™t notice a difference.
            But itâ€™s there as a safety net.

    2. ctr.reset_index(name='ctr')

        - Before this, ctr is probably a Series (like user_id as the index, CTR values as the Series data).

        - .reset_index() moves the index (user_id) back into a normal column.

        - name='ctr' tells pandas: "Name the Series column 'ctr' instead of leaving it unnamed."
