"""
Notes:
    - Handles duplicates correctly

        - It uses Counter to track the frequency of each number.

        - It checks for (2, 2) only if it appears at least twice.

    - Avoids duplicate pairs like (2, 3) and (3, 2)

        - Thanks to frozenset([num, second_num]), which treats both as the same key.

    - Efficient lookup

        - Uses dictionary (Counter) and set for O(1) average time checks.


    - What is Counter?
        Counter from collections is a subclass of dict that counts how many times each item appears in a list.

    - Why is it efficient?
    
        Both:

            num in numbers_counter

            pair_key in seen

        are dictionary or set lookups, which use hash tables internally.

        This means:

        Looking up an item (e.g., 2 in numbers_counter) has average time complexity of O(1) â€” constant time.

        Much faster than scanning a list, which would take O(n).
