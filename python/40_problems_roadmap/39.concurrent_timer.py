Problem:
    You have 5 different timers. Each should "sleep" for a different time and print a message once it finishes. Use threads to let them count down simultaneously.

Notes:

    | Approach                      | Result Order       | Best For                      |
    | ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
    | `executor.map(...)`           | Submission order   | Simplicity, clean syntax      |
    | `submit()` + loop             | Submission order   | More control                  |
    | `submit()` + `as_completed()` | **Finish order** âœ… | Real-time feedback / progress |


    1. map() and submit() both run tasks concurrently using threads (if you're using ThreadPoolExecutor), even if results appear in submission order.

    2. using as_completed with submit is better
