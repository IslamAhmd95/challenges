Problem:
    A thread-safe counter is a counter object that can be safely incremented by multiple threads at the same time without causing data races or incorrect results. It ensures that increments are atomic (only one thread can update it at a time).

"""
Notes:
    1. You MUST call .result() or use as_completed() to ensure thread completion.
        - submit() just queues the function.
        - .result() waits for that thread to finish.
        - Otherwise, print might run before threads finish, giving incorrect counter.

    2. Why executor.map() didn‚Äôt work as expected?
        - Because executor.map() expects a function and an iterable.
        - It blocks until all threads finish, so no .result() is needed.
        - But in your test, the timing or counter might seem wrong if previous test threads didn‚Äôt reset counter = 0.
    
    3. Python GIL = üîê one chef in a kitchen ‚Üí only one thread runs Python bytecode at a time.
