Project Idea
    Library Management System (OOP-based)

Description:
    A Python OOP application to manage books, members, and borrowing/returning operations for a small library.
    It will use core OOP concepts heavily, and sprinkle in advanced ones where they make sense.

Concepts You’ll Apply
    I’ll group them into Core and Advanced so you can see how you’ll revise while coding.

Core OOP Concepts

    Classes & Objects

        Book, Member, Library, BorrowRecord classes.

        Each represents a real-world entity.

    Encapsulation

        Private attributes for sensitive data like _member_id, _available_copies.

        Public getters/setters where needed.

    Inheritance

        EBook and PrintedBook can inherit from Book.

        StudentMember and StaffMember inherit from Member.

    Polymorphism

        Overriding methods, e.g., display_info() could be different for EBook vs. PrintedBook.

        calculate_due_date() may differ for students vs. staff.

    Abstraction (via ABCs)

        Abstract base class Book with abstract method display_info().

        Abstract class Member with abstract method calculate_due_date().


Advanced Concepts

    Dunder Methods

        __str__ for nice printing of objects.

        __eq__ for comparing books by ISBN.

        __len__ to get number of books in the library.

    Class Attributes & Class Methods

        MIN_ALLOWED_DAYS or MAX_BORROWED_BOOKS shared across all members.

        Class methods to create objects from data (e.g., Book.from_dict()).

    Property Decorator

        @property for calculated values like is_available.

        Setter for updating available copies.

    Descriptors (Optional but good revision)

        Could create a descriptor UpperCaseName for ensuring member names are always uppercase.

    Composition

        Library has Book and Member collections as attributes.

        BorrowRecord contains both Member and Book objects.

    Static Methods

        Validation helpers for ISBN or email format.

    Resource Management (__enter__, __exit__)

        Simulate saving data to a file or loading on startup.


Example of How You’ll Apply While Revising

    book.py

        Book (abstract), EBook, PrintedBook

        Use inheritance, polymorphism, and dunder methods.

    member.py

        Member (abstract), StudentMember, StaffMember

        Use class attributes, polymorphism for borrowing limits.

    library.py

        Library class that manages adding/removing books, registering members, borrowing, returning.

        Composition: Library contains collections of Book and Member objects.

    borrow.py

        BorrowRecord class to track borrowed books, due dates.

    descriptors.py (optional)

        UpperCaseName descriptor for member names.
