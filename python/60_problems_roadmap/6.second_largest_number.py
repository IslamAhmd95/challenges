Problem:
    Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list of integers.
    The solution should work without using built-in sorting functions like sorted().

Notes:

    Edge cases are special or unusual inputs that can break your code if you donâ€™t handle them.
    They are not common, but they are important to test.

        ðŸ“Œ Simple Examples:
            If you're writing code to find the second largest number in a list:
                - A list with only one number â†’ Example: [5]
                - A list where all numbers are the same â†’ Example: [3, 3, 3]
                - A list with only negative numbers â†’ Example: [-2, -5, -1]
                - A list with two numbers only â†’ Example: [10, 5]

    These are edge cases because they are different from normal cases, and your code must handle them correctly.
