Problem:
    You're given a list of integers. Your task is to compute the sum of squares of these numbers. This is a CPU-bound task, so use Python multiprocessing to speed it up.

"""
Notes:
    1. Use `multiprocessing.Queue()` to share data between processes.
    2. Each process puts its result into the shared queue.
    3. Collect all results using `q.get()` once per process.
    4. Important: `multiprocessing.Queue` is a class â€” must instantiate it with `()`.
    5. 
    | Method                         | Time    | Notes                              |
    | ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
    | `multiprocessing.Pool.map()`   | \~1.02s | Best for simple parallel tasks.    |
    | Manual `Process` + `Queue`     | \~1.02s | More control; same performance.    |
    | `ProcessPoolExecutor + submit` | \~2.02s | Works, but slower due to overhead. |
